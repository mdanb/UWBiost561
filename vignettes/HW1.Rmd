# Instructions

These instructions are essential, so please read them all carefully. 

- Submit your homework as both the RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file and HTML file on your GitHub page. 
(More on this later, as the first homework will guide you on how to do this.) 

- Please answer the question prompt and show your code (inline). That is,
all your code should be visible in the knitted chunks.

- To complete this homework, you may write in the `HW1.Rmd` file. 
(It is recommended to complete this homework in R Studio, where clicking the
`Knit` button would knit your homework.)

# Q1: Setting up an R package and GitHub

<mark>**Intent**: This section is not a question but to guide you 
step-by-step on how to
make an R package and a GitHub, which will be critical for this course.
This question will be challenging for students who are not familiar with
R Studio or GitHub, so please ask the instructor questions.</mark>

Please read and walk through [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sB5qwkeOWnCU-UUkHxOjqUTep0kgpvUi7qtHo7eV8oU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sB5qwkeOWnCU-UUkHxOjqUTep0kgpvUi7qtHo7eV8oU/edit?usp=sharing), as we have mentioned in class.
Upon completion of this walkthrough, to get full marks for this question,
you should have:

1. Created a GitHub account,
2. Created a private GitHub repository called `UWBiost561`,
3. Created an R package, which is located in your GitHub repository `UWBiost561`,
4. Created a vignette, which includes both `HW1.Rmd` and `HW1.html`
under the `vignettes` folder, in your GitHub repository `UWBiost561`,
5. Added the username `linnykos` as a Collaborator to your GitHub repository `UWBiost561`.

<u>**Note**</u>: If you do not have a lot of familiarity with R Studio or GitHub,
this question *will* be quite challenging (even though all you're doing is
following through a walkthrough). Please start this early if you feel nervous
about this because your instructor (Kevin) can better help you if you give
him ample time and come to office hours.

(You do not need to write anything for this question.)

# Q2: Simulating the Central Limit Theorem

<mark>**Intent**: This question is a simple coding exercise to demonstrate
familiarity with how to do basic coding in R.</mark>

Load in the `generate_data` function using the following code (all one line).

```{r}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/generate_data.R")
```

This code sources the `generate_data` function into your current R workspace.

<u>**Question 2A**</u>: 
Read the function (either at the URL provided or by typing `generate_data` into your console), 
and in one to three sentences, describe the input and output of the provided
function and what the function is doing. You may use equations if needed.
<span style="color:red">  
Input: Supposed to be an integer > 0  
Output: A vector that is a mix of numbers sampled from a normal, a gamma, and a chi-squared distribution  
The function first checks that n is a positive integer. It then randomly samples n indices from the set {1, 2, 3}. Each sampled index determines which distribution to draw from:  
If the index is 1, the value is sampled from a Normal distribution: $X \sim \mathcal{N}(10, 1)$.
If the index is 2, the value is sampled from a Gamma distribution: $X \sim \text{Gamma}(2, 2)$.
If the index is 3, the value is sampled from a Chi-squared distribution: $X \sim \chi^2(3)$
</span>

<u>**Question 2B**</u>: 
We will now be using the `generate_data` function.
Observe that if we run the following code, we would compute a (random, empirical) mean of the
a dataset with `n=10` samples:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
mean(generate_data(n=10))
```
Repeat the above code 10,000 times (i.e., 10,000 trials, but keeping `n=10` for
each trial), and plot a histogram of the 10,000 different empirical means with 100 breaks (i.e., `breaks = 100`).
Repeat this process for `n` with values of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 100, and plot these six histograms
in order of increasing `n`. 

Figure \@ref(fig:clt) shows the desired plot you aim to reproduce. 
In particular, reproduce the X- and Y-labels,
the title of the plot, and the plot layout. 
(Hint: You might find the `par` function useful, especially
the `mar` and `mfrow` arguments, as well as the `paste`
function. See the documentation for `par`.)

```{r clt, out.width = "600px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The figure you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 2B, barring the dimensions/proportions of the figure itself and randomness inherent to the simulation.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/clt_editted.png")
```
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
means_df = tibble()

for (n in c(1,2,3,5,10,100)) {
  set.seed(1)
  means = c()
  for (i in seq(1, 10000)) {
    mean_curr = mean(generate_data(n=n))
    means = append(means, mean_curr)
  }
  means_n <- tibble(n = n, mean = means)
  means_df <- bind_rows(means_df, means_n)
}

ggplot(means_df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=mean)) +
  xlab("Value") +
  facet_wrap(~ n, 
             scales = "free", 
             labeller = as_labeller(function(n) paste("Sample size:", n))) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Frquency")
```

<u>**Question 2C**</u>: 
In one to three sentences, write how the plot you reproduced helps to verify 
the Central Limit Theorem.  
<span style="color:red">
We have a mix of multiple random variables from three different distributions. As the 
sample size increases, the distribution of the mean of the sampled data points from these distributions approaches a normal distribution, as the CLT states. 
</span>

# Q3: Basic data analysis

<mark>**Intent**: This question is a simple data analysis to demonstrate
familiarity with how to perform basic operations in R.</mark>

In this question, we'll load a simple dataset related to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) research.
The data originates from a single-cell database from 
[this study](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/seattle-alzheimers-disease).
However, since this is the first homework, we'll mainly work with donor-level
data instead of the cell-level data.

```{r}
df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/sea-ad.csv")

head(df)

summary(df)
```

Here are brief descriptions of each variable:

- `Donor.ID`: The anonymized ID of the donor who donated their brain to AD research
- `Age.at.Death`: The age of the donor when they passed away
- `Sex`: The biological sex of the donor. (Kevin's comment: In this study, it seems like this is strictly only `Male` or `Female`...?)
- `APOE4.Status`: `Y` (for yes) or `N` (for no) if the donor has a particular genetic variant that is known to be a risk factor for AD
- `Cognitive.Status`: Whether the donor has dementia or not based on a wide array of cognitive assessments before death
- `Last.CASI.Score`: The last score the donor had, measured via CASI (a specific set of cognitive questions), before death
- `Braak`: Different severities of neuropathology based on the donor's brain tissue, extracted after the donor's consent and death 

Hopefully, this is a reminder to carefully describe your study variables in any dataset you publish or collaborate on!

<u>**Question 3A**</u>: Describe, in two to four sentences, what the `head(df)`
and `summary(df)` results display.  
<span style="color:red">
The `head` function displays the first 6 observations from the dataframe. The `summary`
function, for numerical variables, displays certain useful statistics like Min, Median, Mean, etc...
For other variables, it displays the length, class (high level type), and mode (low level type). 
</span>

<u>**Question 3B**</u>: Use a simple function to print out the dimensionality
of `df` (i.e., how many rows and columns there are). 
What is the class of `df`?  
```{r}
print(dim(df))
print(class(df))
```  
`df` is a dataframe  
<u>**Question 3C**</u>: You'll note that in `summary(df)`, the variable `Age.at.Death`
is a `character`, even though it should be a numeric. This is because
there are values of `90+`. As a simple diagnostic, 1) replace all the `90+` values
in `df$Age.at.Death` with `90`, 2) convert `df$Age.at.Death` from a character
to a numeric, and 3) plot a histogram of `df$Age.at.Death`.

Figure \@ref(fig:hist) shows the desired plot you aim to reproduce.

```{r hist, out.width = "300px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The figure you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 3C, barring the dimensions/proportions of the figure itself.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/histogram-editted.png")
```

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    Age.at.Death = as.numeric(case_when(
      Age.at.Death == "90+" ~ "90",
      TRUE ~ Age.at.Death  # keep as-is if no match
    )
    )
  )

ggplot(df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Age.at.Death), binwidth = 5, boundary = 65) +
  xlab("Donor age") +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Frquency") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(65, 90, by = 5)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 60, by = 10),
                     limits = c(0, 60))

```

<u>**Question 3D**</u>: The `summary()` function is much more useful when the columns
of `df` are factors, not characters. Write some lines of code to convert the variables
`Sex`, `APOE4.Status`, `Cognitive.Status`, and `Braak` to be factors. (This should take
less than 10 lines of code.)

```{r}
df = df %>%
      mutate(Sex=as.factor(Sex),
             APOE4.Status=as.factor(APOE4.Status),
             Cognitive.Status=as.factor(Cognitive.Status),
             Braak=as.factor(Braak))
```


<u>**Question 3E**</u>: With this new version of `df`, after finishing the previous
questions, show the result of `summary(df)`.

```{r}
summary(df)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:summary) shows the desired output you aim to reproduce.

```{r summary, out.width = "400px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The intended output of Question 3E.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/summary-editted.png")
```

In one sentence, describe how the summary here (in Question 3E) is more
informative than the summary shown at the start of Question 3.

<span style="color:red">
Here, the summary function actually lists the values that make up the factors and how many there is of each.
</span>

<u>**Question 3F**</u>: Using the `table()` function, display the relation
between `Braak` and `Cognitive.Status`. Please look at `?table` (for the documentation
of `table()`) if you are unfamiliar with this function.
```{r}
table(df$Braak, df$Cognitive.Status)
```

<u>**Question 3G**</u>: This question will be slightly challenging. The `table()`
function is not as useful when there are many unique values (such as in `Last.CASI.Score`).
To overcome this, look up the documentation for the `cut` and `quantile` functions.
The goal is to use the `table()`, `cut()`, and `quantile()` to
show the relation of the quantiles of `Last.CASI.Score` with `Cognitive.Status`.
You will want to use `na.rm=TRUE` when using the `quantile()` function.

Figure \@ref(fig:table) shows the desired output you aim to reproduce.

```{r table, out.width = "200px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The intended output of Question 3G.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW1_files/table-editted.png")
```

```{r}
quantiles = df %>% pull(Last.CASI.Score) %>% quantile(na.rm=T)
df = df %>% mutate(Last.CASI.Score = cut(Last.CASI.Score, quantiles))
table(df$Last.CASI.Score, df$Cognitive.Status)
```

In one to two sentences, describe what you can learn from the relation between
`Last.CASI.Score` and `Cognitive.Status` based on this result.  
<span style="color:red">
Based on this, it seems like people with dementia tend to have lower CASI scores, 
while those without dementia tend to have higher CASI scores. 
</span>


# Q4: Pushing the homework onto GitHub

<mark>**Intent**: This section is not a question but a guide 
on submitting your homework. This procedure will 
be the expectation for all future homeworks.</mark>

Now that you have completed this homework, all that's remaining is to
push this homework onto your `UWBiost561` GitHub repository.
To do this, please ensure:

1. Your file is named `HW1.Rmd`. (This current homework file you are
writing in will replace the initial `HW1.Rmd` you made when
you completed the walkthrough in Question 1.)
2. Your file is in the `vignettes` folder in your `UWBiost561` R package.
3. You push your two files, `HW1.Rmd` and `HW1.html` (the latter is the knitted HTML file) onto your GitHub repository.
4. Double-check that you can see both files online on github.com when you look at your repository.
5. *LASTLY*: Upload `HW1.html` to Canvas under "Assignment 1". (This is for university-wide policy, but also helps me keep track of completion status of homeworks via Canvas.)

Again, ensure the username `linnykos` is added to your private GitHub repository. And with that, you're done! (For future homeworks, you will be "submitting" your homeworks like this.)

(You do not need to write anything for this question.)

# Q5: Feedback (Optional)

This "question" is an additional way for students to communicate with instructors. 
You could include positive feedback about topics you enjoyed learning this module, critiques about 
the course difficulty/pacing, 
or some questions/confusions you had about course material.
Your feedback can help us shape the course for the rest of this quarter and 
future years. Please be mindful and polite when providing feedback.
You may leave this question blank.
