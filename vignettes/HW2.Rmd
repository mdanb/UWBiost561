# Instructions

These instructions are essential, so please read them all carefully. 

- Submit your homework on your GitHub page as the RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) and HTML files. 

- Please answer the question prompt and show your code (inline). That is,
all your code should be visible in the knitted chunks.

- To complete this homework, you may write in the `HW2.Rmd` file. 
(It is recommended to complete this homework in R Studio, where clicking the
`Knit` button would knit your homework.)

# Disclosures

- Please disclose below who you collaborated with and if you've used ChatGPT (or any
comparable AI tool) to what extent when completing this homework. See the syllabus
for the course expectations.

(Hint: If you feel stuck in this homework,
feel free to consult ChatGPT. Often, you need to double-check
the responses from ChatGPT to verify its correctness. I would advise
you to ask ChatGPT to generate minimal examples to demonstrate how to 
use various functions, as this will provide you with a clear example of 
how the function works.)

# Q0: Setting up your `UWBiost561` package

You do not need to write anything about any part of this question.

<u>**Question 0A**</u>: Install `tidyverse`. (This will involve typing `install.packages("tidyverse")`
in the R console. You do not need to put this in your
Markdown file.) 

<u>**Question 0B**</u>: Update `DESCRIPTION` in your R package. That is, there is a file
called `DESCRIPTION` in your `UWBiost561` package. It should look something like this:
```
Suggests: 
  knitr,
  rmarkdown
```

Add the following lines to the `DESCRIPTION` to include `bookdown`, `tidyverse`, and `ggplot2`. It should look like something like:
```
Suggests: 
  knitr,
  rmarkdown,
  bookdown,
  tidyverse,
  ggplot2
```

Save the file and close it. 

<u>**Question 0C**</u>: Make sure you can load your package. (You need the `bookdown` 
package to knit the homework, similar to HW1.) 

```{r}
library(bookdown)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

(This might throw a warning about a "conflicted package." You can ignore it.)

<u>**Question 0D**</u>: Double check the following things about your R package:

  - Your `HW1.html`, `HW1.Rmd`, `HW2.Rmd` (this file), and your to-be-created `HW2.html` files are **only** in the `vignettes` folder of your R package.
  There is no `.gitignore` file in the `vignettes` folder. (Please delete the `.gitignore` file if one exists.)

# Q1: Practice using tibbles

<mark>**Intent**: This question is to give you some basic practice
using tibbles (and the tidyverse way of analyzing data, overall).</mark>

For this question, we'll be using two datasets that collect various
statistics of countries over many years. The first dataset is the `gt` package (see [https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/gt/html/countrypops.html](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/gt/html/countrypops.html)), and has been formatted specifically for this homework. It
can be loaded in the following code:

```{r}
country_population <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/country_population.csv")
country_population
```


(Note that we're reading the data using the `readr::read_csv` function, which automatically converts the `csv` data into a `tibble`. This is not the same as the `read.csv` function. See `?readr::read_csv` and `?read.csv`.)
`country_population` contains the following columns:

- `iso3c`: Three-letter country code (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3))
- `country`: Country name
- `year`: Year the statistic is collected
- `population`: Population, based on the World Bank estimate 

The next dataset is from [https://paldhous.github.io/NICAR/2017/r-analysis.html](https://paldhous.github.io/NICAR/2017/r-analysis.html), and has also been formatted specifically for this homework. It
can be loaded in the following code:

```{r}
country_birth <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/country_birth.csv")
country_birth
```

`country_birth` contains the following columns:

- `iso2c`: Two-letter country code
- `iso3c`: Three-letter country code
- `year`: Year the statistic is collected
- `life_expect`: Life expectancy at birth, in years.
- `birth_rate`: Live births during the year per 1,000 people
- `neonat_mortal_rate`: Neonatal mortality rate: babies dying before reaching 28 days of age per 1,000 live births in a given year

This question will allow you to practice basic data manipulation of these two `tibble` objects.

<u>**Question 1A**</u>: We will be manipulating the `country_population` data in this question.
Your goal is the following: 
Select only rows for years between 1990 and 2010 (inclusive).
Then, compute the mean population across all the years of a country
for each country (defining a new variable called `mean_population`,
via the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions).

Figure \@ref(fig:population) shows the first two rows of your desired output.

```{r population, out.width = "350px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The output you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 1A.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/population.png")
```

```{r}
answer = country_population %>% 
          filter(year >= 1990 & year <= 2010) %>%
          group_by(iso3c) %>% 
          summarize(country=first(country),
                    mean_population = mean(population),
                    .groups = "drop")
answer

```

<u>**Question 1B**</u>: 
We will be manipulating the `country_birth` data in this question.
Your goal is the following: 
Select only rows for years between 1990 and 2010 (inclusive),
keep the `iso3c`, `year`, `life_expect` columns, and
then drop all rows with any `NA` in any of the 3 columns.
Then, compute the minimum and maximum life expectancy (named as new columns
called `min_life_expect` and `max_life_expect`) for each country
across all the years (via the `summarize()` function),
and finally, create a new column called `range_life_expect` that is the number of years between `min_life_expect` and `max_life_expect`
for each country (via the `mutate()` function).


Figure \@ref(fig:birth) shows the first two rows of your desired output.

```{r birth, out.width = "350px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The output you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 1B.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/birth.png")
```

```{r}
answer = country_birth %>% 
          filter(year >= 1990 & year <= 2010) %>%
          drop_na(iso3c, year, life_expect) %>% 
          group_by(iso3c) %>%
          summarize(min_life_expect=round(min(life_expect), 2), 
                    max_life_expect=round(max(life_expect), 2)) %>%
          mutate(range_life_expect = round(max_life_expect - min_life_expect, 2))
```
<u>**Question 1C**</u>: We will now combine `country_population` and `country_birth`
via a join.
Specifically, using an `inner_join()` function, combine both these
datasets by the `iso3c` variable, and call the new `tibble` object as
`country_both`. Print out the first 10 rows of `country_both`. How many rows and columns are in `country_both`?

```{r}
country_both = country_population %>% 
  inner_join(country_birth, by = "iso3c")
head(country_both, 10)
```

<span style="color:red">
There are 343980 rows and 8 columns
</span>


# Q2: Practice using ggplot via scatterplots and facets

<mark>**Intent**: This question is to give you some basic practice using
ggplot, mainly plotting scatterplots and faceting the plots.</mark>

For this question, we'll be using a dataset about the penguins from the Palmer Archipelago from [https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html). We've processed it lightly for this homework. 

```{r}
penguins <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/palmerpenguins.csv")
penguins
```

You can see its original documentation for describing the variables in the dataset.

The following code makes a basic scatter plot. We will be improving this plot
over the following sub-questions.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

<u>**Question 2A**</u>: With the `penguins` dataset,
change the x-axis label and y-axis label to
say `Bill Depth (mm)` and `Bill length (mm)` respectively,
as well as the title of the plot to write `Relation among ??? penguins`,
where you use code to count how many rows there are in `penguins` automatically (in place of `???`).
Additionally, color each point based on their `species`, 
where `Adelie` has the color `cornflowerblue`, 
`Chinstrap` has the color `coral2`,
and `Gentoo` has the color `goldenrod3`.

(Hint: You will likely need the `scale_color_manual()`, `labs()`, and `paste()` functions.)

(You can see 
[https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf](https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) to see where these color names come from.)

Figure \@ref(fig:scatterplot) shows the plot you are trying to reproduce.

```{r scatterplot, out.width = "400px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The plot you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 2A.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/scatterplot-colored.png")
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Bill Depth (mm)") +
  ylab("Bill length (mm)") +
  ggtitle(paste("Relation among", nrow(penguins), "penguins")) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("Adelie"="cornflowerblue", 
                              "Chinstrap"="coral2", 
                              "Gentoo"="goldenrod3"))

```


<u>**Question 2B**</u>: We now will make the following changes: 
1) we will facet the scatterplot based on the `species`, 
2) we will add a linear regression fit on each `species` (regression
`bill_length_mm` onto the `bill_depth_mm`) and plot the linear regression fit, and
3) changing the transparency of the points to be 50\% transparent (i.e., `alpha=0.5`).

(Hint: This question is a bit tricky since many things are going on.
You will likely need the `geom_smooth()` and `facet_wrap()` functions.)

Figure \@ref(fig:facet) shows the plot you are trying to reproduce.

```{r facet, out.width = "400px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The plot you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 2B.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/facet.png")
```

```{r}
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color=species)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  facet_wrap(vars(species)) +
  xlab("Bill Depth (mm)") +
  ylab("Bill length (mm)") +
  ggtitle(paste("Relation among", nrow(penguins), "penguins")) +
  scale_color_manual(values=c("Adelie"="cornflowerblue", 
                              "Chinstrap"="coral2", 
                              "Gentoo"="goldenrod3"))

```


# Q3: Practice using ggplot via heatmaps

<mark>**Intent**: This question is to give you some basic practice using
ggplot, mainly plotting heatmaps. You will also see this `generate_random_graph()` function again in future homeworks.</mark>

Run the following code to load the `generate_random_graph()`, which generates `adj_mat`, a random adjacency matrix (corresponding to a graph with 20 nodes).  Each row/column of `adj_mat` corresponds to one of the 20 nodes, and a value of 0 or 1 denotes the lack or presence of an edge between two nodes, respectively.

```{r}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/random_graph_functions.R")
```

```{r}
set.seed(0)
result <- generate_random_graph(n = 20,
                                clique_fraction = 0.5,
                                density_low = 0.1)
adj_mat <- result$adj_mat
dim(adj_mat)
adj_mat[1:5,1:5]
```

<u>**Question 3A**</u>: Read how the provided `generate_random_graph()` works (either typing `generate_random_graph` into the R console
or reading the code at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/random_graph_functions.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/random_graph_functions.R)). In three to five sentences, describe what `generate_random_graph()` does.

<span style="color:red">
`generate_random_graph()`  generates a random undirected graph with a random clique of nodes. To do this, it first checks that the arguments are valid. It then generates a random graph by sampling 0s and 1s (with a density of `density_low` for 1s). The adjacency matrix of the graph is then made symmetric, the clique is formed, and the node indices are randomized. Finally, it returns as a list both the adjacency matrix of the graph and the way the indices were randomized to create the graph (this would allow to undo the randomization). 
</span>


<u>**Question 3B**</u>: You will now write code to produce a heatmap to visualize `adj_mat`. Before this can happen, though,
you need one more function to convert `adj_mat` into a "long form,"
which is a necessity when visualizing any plot as a heatmap in ggplot. 
See [https://r-graph-gallery.com/heatmap.html](https://r-graph-gallery.com/heatmap.html). This is done via the provided `pivot_longer_heatmap()` function:

```{r}
mat_long <- pivot_longer_heatmap(adj_mat)
mat_long
```

Read what the `pivot_longer_heatmap()` function
does (either typing `pivot_longer_heatmap` into the R console
or reading the code at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/random_graph_functions.R](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/random_graph_functions.R)). In three to five sentences, describe what `pivot_longer_heatmap()` does. Specifically, how does the output of
`pivot_longer_heatmap()` relate to `adj_mat`?

(Hint: For this question, it might be helpful to manually run the function line-by-line in your R console to see what each line of code does. The hardest part of this question will be understanding what the `pivot_longer` function does.
Look at the documentation of this function via `?tidyr::pivot_longer`. It might also be helpful to recall, in your R console, what the values of `adj_mat[1,1]`, `adj_mat[1,2]`, `adj_mat[1,3]`, ... are. How do they look similar to rows in `mat_long`?)

<span style="color:red">
As the name of the function suggests, this will convert an adjacency matrix into long format. Each triplet of row (the actual new column "Row" that was added as part of the function), column, and value within a given position row i, column j, will now be a row in the new long format. The column names will be X (for the row), Y (for the column), and Value for the actual value (1 or 0, indicating absense or presence of an edge). 
</span>

<u>**Question 3C**</u>: Now you are ready to write code to visualize `mat_long` as a heatmap. Write code using ggplot's functions to do this. You want to color all the `0` values as `palegoldenrod` and all the `1` values as `coral2`. Please set the aspect ratio of this plot to be 1:1 (i.e., your "boxes" are squares) via the `coord_fixed()` function.

In two to four sentences, describe how the plot you made relates to `adj_mat`.

(Hint: This question will be tricky, even though you need only roughly 7 functions. You likely want to use the `geom_tile()` and `scale_fill_manual()` functions.)

Figure \@ref(fig:adjmat) shows the plot you are trying to reproduce.

```{r adjmat, out.width = "350px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The plot you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 3C.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/adj_mat.png")
```

```{r}
ggplot(mat_long) +
  geom_tile(aes(X, Y, fill=as.character(Value)), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("0"="palegoldenrod",
                             "1"="coral2"),
                    name = "Value") +
  xlab("Column") +
  ylab("Row") +
  coord_fixed()

```

<u>**Question 3D**</u>: Congratulations! You have a working pipeline to visualize any adjacency matrix. For this last question,
we will combine all your functions to visualize the following:

```{r}
adj_mat2 <- result$adj_mat[result$rev_order, result$rev_order]
```

You can double-check yourself to see that this line of code only permutes the rows and columns. The actual "graph" does not change (since the ordering of the rows/columns is arbitrary).

Use the provided `pivot_longer_heatmap()` function and your code from Question 3C to visualize `adj_mat2`. (You are mainly copy-pasting the code from your previous questions but now applying it to `adj_mat2`.)

You will see a dense set of red blocks in the bottom-left corner of the heatmap. In two sentences, 
what does this plot tell us about `adj_mat2`, and in turn,
about `adj_mat`? (Hint: Question 4 will give you some context to answer this question.)

Figure \@ref(fig:adjmat2) shows the plot you are trying to reproduce.

```{r adjmat2, out.width = "350px", fig.align="center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=c("The plot you are trying to reproduce (without the Sample watermark) in Question 3D.")}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linnykos/561_s2025_public/main/HW2_files/adj_mat2.png")
```
```{r}
adj_mat2 <- result$adj_mat[result$rev_order, result$rev_order]
mat_long2 <- pivot_longer_heatmap(adj_mat2)
ggplot(mat_long2) +
  geom_tile(aes(X, Y, fill=as.character(Value)), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("0"="palegoldenrod",
                             "1"="coral2"),
                    name = "Value") +
  xlab("Column") +
  ylab("Row") +
  coord_fixed()

```
<span style="color:red">
The plot tells us that `adj_mat2` contains a set of fully connected nodes. This is also true for `adj_mat` since it's the same as `adj_mat2`, except the nodes indices are randomly permuted, and hence the clique is not visually apparent. 
</span>

# Q4: Planning for the next homework -- thinking how to test a function

<mark>**Intent**: This question will get you started on how to think about testing a function.</mark>

Question 3 demonstrates a "planted clique" -- there might be a clique in a random graph (i.e., a collection of connected nodes). This clique might not be evident at first glance (as demonstrated in Question 3C), but when you permute the rows and columns (as done in Question 3D), the clique is quite apparent. (In Lecture 4, we will go over the basics of thinking about graphs and adjacency matrices. Please watch the Panopto recording on Canvas if you want some context.)

Suppose your teammate gave you a function to find the **maximal clique** in an adjacency matrix (i.e., the set of nodes that forms the largest clique).
You are not told the typical size and characteristics of these adjacency matrices beforehand.
Your job is to make sure this function is correct since you and your teammate are about to give this function to your manager, who will then give it to another division in your company to use. Your performance review will depend highly on whether or not other people in your company can reliably use your function.

In a short paragraph, write down ways to ensure your
teammate's function is "correct." Please list at least four different ways you can test this function. You can interpret this notion of "correct" very liberally -- this question is purposely framed to be open-ended.

(I am purposely not giving you the implementation of such a function.
Please do not use ChatGPT for this specific question.)

(For those curious, this is the "Maximal Clique Problem" (MCP), which is a classic example of a "hard" problem in Computer Science theory. See [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09742](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09742). You do not need to read this paper to complete this question -- it's simply for additional reading for curious students.)

<ol style="color:red;">
  <li>Come up with specific examples of graphs with known cliques and make sure the 
  function can return the set of nodes that form the maximal cliques.</li>
  <li>Come up with specific examples of graphs with NO cliques and make sure the 
  function returns an empty set.</li>
  <li>Pass in a fully disconnected graph and make sure the function returns an empty set</li>
  <li>Pass in incorrect arguments to the function (e.g wrong type of data) and
  make sure the function either warns the user or throws an error</li>
</ol>
