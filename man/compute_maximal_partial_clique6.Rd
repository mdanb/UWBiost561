\title{Compute maximal partial clique}
\usage{
compute_maximal_partial_clique6(adj_mat, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj_mat}{A symmetric binary adjacency matrix with diagonal 1s and no row/column names.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0.5 and 1. The minimum density required in the clique.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{clique_idx}{Indices of nodes in the maximal partial clique.}
\item{edge_density}{The edge density among the selected nodes.}
}
}
\description{
This function finds a reasonably large set of nodes in a graph (represented by
an adjacency matrix) that forms a partial clique with edge density at least alpha.
It uses a greedy approach to expand from highly connected nodes.
